# C-Program-check-odd-and-even

Hello I have made a simple C program to check odd and even it is very simple if you get a number example 4 so it can be perfectly divided by 2 so it is even if its not then its an odd

Code 

#include<stdio.h>
void main()
{
char sohumkalia(){
int number;
scanf("%d",&number);

if(number%2==0){
    printf("its even");
}else{
    printf("its odd");
}
}
sohumkalia();
}
